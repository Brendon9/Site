Originally from the Dallas Fort Worth area, Brendon moved to New York in March
of 2014 after graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington to pursue a
passion for software and startup communities.

At IceHook Systems he is building web applications based on a Rails API server
used by Javascript and WebRTC to stream audio and video end to end on Chrome,
Firefox and Opera.
