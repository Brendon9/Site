Originally from the Dallas Fort Worth area, I moved to New York in March of 2014
after graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington to pursue a passion
for software and startup communities.

I have experience working on the cutting edge and solving unique problems, e.g.
(implementing WebRTC across Firefox, Chrome and Opera to stream video/audio end
to end). When these problems arise I first search for a solution in my existing
codebase or the codebase of my associates. If no solution is found this way this
way, I search for others that have had a similar challenge, I experiment by
digging to the source and then documenting my findings. When a solution is found
I then mold my findings to conform to the existing software environment and
modularize it for future use in my codebase. I find this process limits repeat
work and when done narrows a wide body of code.

At IceHook Systems, with a small agile team, I built simultaneous web applications
in Ruby on Rails with a REST API used by Javascript and large DNS lookup tables
using PowerDNS to forward phone numbers en masse. I supported existing software
with message queuing using Redis and number of job workers to process huge
numbers of call data records.

At Texas Instruments, with a large team of engineers, I created web applications
using Java Spring and automation scripts that run on their existing factory
procedures. I obtained knowledge of advanced enterprise architectures and patterns
by working with internal infrastructure like Jenkins, CVS and in-house code
deployment methods. Things were done in a waterfall fashion starting from
gathering requirements, to writing to tests to writing self documenting code to
performing code reviews and finally staging and deploying software.
