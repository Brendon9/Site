Originally from the Dallas Fort Worth area, I moved to New York in March of 2014
after graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington to pursue a passion
for software and startup communities.

On April 1st I joined a small team of two guys, Randy Weinberger and Keith Larrimore,
at their start up IceHook Systems. Working in such a small team provided me the
opportunity to learn the day to day of how a start up operates from the day to day
as well become a jack-of-all-trades. From the styling of the company website to
the inner workings or their Call Data Record software, Slinger, I would need to
know it all. In order to become familiar with the technologies used at IceHook I
began to construct Scout, an advanced caller id. Using Rails as an API server,
Scout would take a phone number and through fuzzy logic produce as much information
as possible from Google and our friends at Nextcaller. People were excited about
Scout but it needed a vessel to really show well. This is where FireRTC came from.
